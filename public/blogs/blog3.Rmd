# Challenge 2: Excess rentals in TfL bike sharing

Recall the TfL data on how many bikes were hired every single day. We can get the latest data by running the following

```{r, get_tfl_data, cache=TRUE}
url <- "https://data.london.gov.uk/download/number-bicycle-hires/ac29363e-e0cb-47cc-a97a-e216d900a6b0/tfl-daily-cycle-hires.xlsx"

# Download TFL data to temporary file
httr::GET(url, write_disk(bike.temp <- tempfile(fileext = ".xlsx")))

# Use read_excel to read it as dataframe
bike0 <- read_excel(bike.temp,
                   sheet = "Data",
                   range = cell_cols("A:B"))

# change dates to get year, month, and week
bike <- bike0 %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  rename (bikes_hired = number_of_bicycle_hires) %>% 
  mutate (year = year(day),
          month = lubridate::month(day, label = TRUE),
          week = isoweek(day))
```



We can easily create a facet grid that plots bikes hired by month and year.

```{r tfl_absolute_monthly_change_code}

#first we need to filter our database to have only years >= 2015
bike_filtered <- 
  bike %>% filter(year >= 2015)

#summarizing per month - we don't need the week value, only monthly
bike_filtered <- 
  bike_filtered %>% 
  group_by(year,month) %>% 
  summarize(bikes_hired = mean(bikes_hired))

#now we will calculate the monthly average throughout the years and save it in a new column
bike_filtered <- 
  bike_filtered %>% 
  group_by(month) %>% 
  mutate(average_hire = mean(bikes_hired)) %>% 
  ungroup()

#calculate the change from monthly average
bike_filtered <-
  bike_filtered  %>% 
  mutate(change_monthlyavg = bikes_hired - average_hire)

#we will first need to interpolate the dataframe to fix graph intersections while making the ribbon
bike_interp <- bike_filtered  %>% 
  #splitting the dataframe - one for each year
  split(.$year) %>% 
  #now we will create a df of interpolated values using map
                      #interpolated months and bikes hired
  map_df(~data.frame(year = approx(.x$month, .x$bikes_hired, n = 80), 
                     #interpolated months and avg hire
                     nat = approx(.x$month, .x$average_hire, n = 80), 
                     #label for each year
                     year = .x$year[1],
                     #label for each month
                     month = .x$month[1]))

#creating a vector with month names
month_label <- c("Jan", "Feb", "Mar",
           "Apr", "May", "Jun",
           "Jul", "Aug","Sep", 
           "Oce", "Nov", "Dec")

#now we will plot our graph with these interpolated values
challenge2.1 <- ggplot(bike_interp, aes(x = nat.x,y= nat.y)) +  facet_wrap(~year) +
  geom_line(color = "#1d00f6", size = 2) +

  scale_x_continuous(breaks= c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12),
        labels=month_label) +
  #adding titles
  labs(title = "Monthly changes in TfL bike rentals",
       subtitle = "Change from monthly average shown in blue \nand calculated between 2015-2019",
       caption = "Source: TfL, London Data Store",
       y = "Bike rentals",
       x = "") +

        axis.title = element_text(face = "bold"),
