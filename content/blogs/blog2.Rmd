# Use `lubridate` to fix dates, as they are given as characters.

  mutate(modeldate = mdy(modeldate), startdate = mdy(startdate), enddate = mdy(enddate), createddate = mdy(createddate), timestamp = parse_date_time(timestamp, orders = "hmsdmy"))

## Create a plot

What I would like you to do is to calculate the average net approval rate (approve- disapprove) for each week since he got into office. I want you plot the net approval, along with its 95% confidence interval. For this analysis I will use the `enddate`, i.e., the date the poll ended, in order to compute the weeks.

```{r trump_margins_weekly, out.width="100%"}

alpha <- 0.05

approval_pollist_summary <- approval_polllist_cleaned %>% 
  filter(subgroup=="Voters") %>% 
  mutate(week = week(enddate), year = year(enddate)) %>% 
  mutate(avg_net_approval = adjusted_approve - adjusted_disapprove, year = year(enddate)) %>% 
  group_by(week, year) %>% 
  summarise(year = year, week = week,
            mean_approval = mean(avg_net_approval),
            lower = mean(avg_net_approval) - qt(1- alpha/2, (n() - 1))*sd(avg_net_approval)/sqrt(n()),
            upper = mean(avg_net_approval) + qt(1- alpha/2, (n() - 1))*sd(avg_net_approval)/sqrt(n())
            ) %>% 
 unique(by = c("week", "year")) %>% 
  arrange(year, week)

trump_plot <- ggplot(approval_pollist_summary, aes(x=week,y=mean_approval, color = as.factor(year))) + 
  geom_line() + 
  facet_wrap(~year) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_hline(yintercept=0, color = "gold") +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin=lower, ymax=upper), linetype=1, alpha=0.1) +
  labs(title = "Estimating Net Approval (approve-disapprove) for Donal Trump", subtitle = "Weekly average polls", y = "Average Net Approval (%)", x = "Week of the year") + 
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position="none") +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("#FF736C","#7DAE00","#00BBBD","#C47EFF")) + 
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::number_format(accuracy = 0.1, decimal.mark = '.'), 
              breaks = c(7.5, 5, 2.5,0.0,-2.5, -5.0, -7.5, -10.0, -12.5, -15.0, -17.5, -20.0)) + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(0, 13, 26, 39, 52))

## Compare Confidence Intervals

When looking at the interval from `week 15` (6-12 April 2020) to `week 34` (17-23 August 2020) we can see that while the average net approval is decreasing, the 95% confidence interval is growing. This could be a result of Trumps strongly debated handling of the covid crisis as well as controversial stand on the black lives matter movement loosing him followers and support. The increase in the confidence interval could also be a result of this, as well as the uncertain times right now, leading people to be more undecided and unsure about their vote.
